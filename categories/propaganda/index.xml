      <title>Hooli’s Hot New Hardware</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This article originally appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coderag.com/hoolis-hot-new-hardware/&#34;&gt;CodeRag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Hooli acquired Endframe, no one could wait to see what the tech giant would do with the revolutionary, middle-out compression technology. The wait is over: In a savvy pivot, Hooli took the software and created their newest hardware: the Hooli/Endframe Box. While initially conceived as a consumer-facing platform, the Endframe technology has been repurposed to “make the world a better place through secure, high-capacity enterprise data storage servers utilizing middle-out compression technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insanely simple and beautifully crafted, the hardware backs up large amounts of data at a fraction of what it used to cost, so it’s no surprise that enterprise top dog Maleant Data System Solutions jumped at the chance to make a multi-year deal for the product. At a press conference announcing the blockbuster deal, CEO Calvin Greene stated, “The Hooli/Endframe Box is a welcome integration with our banking and medical system clients, who need to process large amounts of secure data at an accelerated pace.” Hooli’s Gavin Belson quipped that the world “always needs more money and doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware features a Dual Intel Haswell 2.6 Ghz processor, NVIDIA Tesla K80, Lightnight Eco Gen II SanDisk (800 TB, no less) and two 4TB Seagate hard drives. Matched with Endframe’s middle out algorithm, there’s a reason Maleant promises a 200 percent ROI to any client who elects to incorporate the Hooli/Endframe Box into their service deal with Maleant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies flirted with multiple deal options before sealing the deal on a white label agreement, and becoming the power couple of enterprise data storage. Hooli could sell upgraded versions of these boxes to Maleant indefinitely, and Maleant’s penetration in the enterprise market ensures high demand for more Hooli/Endframe Boxes as long as Hooli can keep making them. Hundreds of millions of dollars could follow for Hooli’s enterprise sales division. With these two joining to sell storage solutions, no one will be able to touch their profits—or their data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Belson Back on Top</title>
      <link>http://sigven.github.io/blog/second/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This post originally appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coderag.com/belson-back-on-top-hoolis-ceo-focusing-on-the-bottom-line/&#34;&gt;CodeRag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavin Belson’s brilliant leadership is unstoppable. While allegedly taking a personal hiatus from day-to-day operations at Hooli, Belson couldn’t resist brokering a blockbuster deal between Hooli and Maleant Data Systems, deploying Hooli’s innovative new Hooli/Endframe Box. The multi-year deal brings handsome margins for Hooli and can easily be a template to apply across the entire Fortune 1000. An inside source tells me that, no surprise, the board was no longer satisfied to let Belson fade into the background. Hat in hand, they begged Belson to come back to the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been barely two months since Belson announced he would be taking a leave from his leadership role in order to focus on spiritual wellness and family. What drove Belson to this decision remains unclear. Was it additional fallout from the Hooli-Search scandal we broke at this very blog? Or perhaps his cutthroat methods in managing Hooli-Search results indicate a demand across the board for higher standards, and as such, Belson could not tolerate the sloppy security upgrades we also reported on. In any case, it seems the company’s electrical issues are resolved, and with it, any spirituality Belson felt the need to examine. The company’s Chief Innovation Officer has returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belson, who is single, has had a slew of successes at Hooli this past year. When he announced the dissolution of the Nucleus project, his bravery was rewarded as Hooli stock jumped 7 percent. The cost savings was compounded when Belson pulled the trigger on company-wide layoffs, and the hole left by Nucleus was quickly filled when he acquired middle-out company Endframe. Endframe’s tech has long dominated the middle-out space, and it’s no surprise that the Hooli/Endframe relationship has combined Hooli’s resources and innovation with Endframe’s impressive tech to create something obscenely profitable: the Hooli/Endframe Box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Belson back on top at Hooli, shareholders can breathe a sigh of relief. While Belson’s career is certainly not without drama, his shrewd business sense and innovative technological accomplishments are what’s shaped Hooli into the company it is today. Without Gavin Belson, there is no Hooli. And without Hooli, where would any of us be?&lt;/p&gt;
