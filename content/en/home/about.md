I am a research scientist working at the [Institute for Cancer Research](https://radium.no) in Oslo, Norway. Most of my activities
involve cancer data science, i.e. analysis of data from high-throughput molecular profiling of tumor samples. I am currently affiliated with the [Centre for Cancer Cell Reprogramming (CanCell)](http://www.med.uio.no/cancell/english/), as well as the
[Centre for Bioinformatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/) at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. My background is in computer science from [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no)/[University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu), and I received my [PhD in computational biology](/thesis/PhD_Thesis_SigveNakken.pdf) from the [Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience](http://www.cmbn.no) at the [University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no).
