I am a research scientist working at the [Institute for Cancer Research](http://radium.no), Oslo University Hospital, Norway. Most of my research activities involve various types of [cancer data science](#research). I am currently affiliated with the [Centre for Cancer Cell Reprogramming (CanCell)](http://www.med.uio.no/cancell/english/), as well as the
[Centre for Bioinformatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/) at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. My background is in computer science from [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no)/[University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), and I received my [PhD in computational biology](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8lfc7c8hg32ryr/PhD_Thesis_SigveNakken.pdf?dl=0) from the [Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience](http://www.cmbn.no) at the [University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no).
