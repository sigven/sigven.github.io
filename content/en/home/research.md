I develop computational interpretation frameworks and analyze data from high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. Below are some of my ongoing research activities:

   * _Cancer genome interpretation_
      * Development of decision support tools for precision cancer medicine: [Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR)](https://sigven.github.io/pcgr)
   * _Data integration for cancer systems biology_
      * Gene set interpretation in high-throughput cancer biology with [oncoEnrichR](https://sigven.github.io/oncoEnrichR)
   * _Computational modeling of drug response in cancer_
   * _Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical trial descriptions_
   * _Hereditary cancers - risk assessment and variant interpretation_
      * [Cancer Predisposition Sequencing Reporter (CPSR)](https://sigven.github.io/cpsr)
      * [Risk assessment in Lynch Syndrome](http://lscarisk.org/)

I supervise MSc students at the [Department of Informatics, University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/), which have included projects on: 

* [text mining of clinical trial data](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/38306)
* [evaluation of methods for cancer driver gene prediction](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/41622)
* [cluster analysis of data from genome-wide association studies](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/53017)
* [comparison of somatic and germline mutational spectra](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/57756)
* [mutational signatures in cancer - relationship to drug response and survival](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rusw18qvf3pt9bd/Mut_Sig_Survival_Drug_Response.pdf?dl=0)

Papers I have co-authored can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=tasITLoAAAAJ&hl=en) page.
