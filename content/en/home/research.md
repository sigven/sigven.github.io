Main ongoing research activities:

   * _Cancer genome interpretation_
   * _Data integration for cancer systems biology_
   * _Computational modeling of drug response in cancer_
   * _Hereditary cancers - risk assessment and variant interpretation_

I supervise MSc students at the [Department of Informatics, University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/), which have included projects on: 

* [text mining of clinical trial data](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/38306)
* [evaluation of methods for cancer driver gene prediction](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/41622)
* [cluster analysis of data from genome-wide association studies](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/53017)
* [comparison of somatic and germline mutational spectra](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/57756)
* [mutational signatures in cancer - relationship to drug response and survival](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rusw18qvf3pt9bd/Mut_Sig_Survival_Drug_Response.pdf?dl=0)
