I am a computational research scientist working in the [Department of Tumor Biology](https://www.ous-research.no/tumorbiology/) at the [Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Norway](https://www.ous-research.no/institute/). 

Most of my research activities involve various types of cancer data science. I have a keen interest in the development of solutions for DNA variant interpretation, and more generally frameworks to support cancer precision medicine (see also [projects](https://sigven.github.io/pages/projects/))

I am currently affiliated with the [Centre for Cancer Cell Reprogramming (CanCell)](http://www.med.uio.no/cancell/english/), as well as the
[Centre for Bioinformatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/sbi/english/) at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. 

I have a background in informatics from [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](http://www.ntnu.no)/[University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), and I received my [PhD in computational genomics](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b8lfc7c8hg32ryr/PhD_Thesis_SigveNakken.pdf?dl=0) from the [Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience](http://www.cmbn.no) at the [University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no).
